    Schema to capture the irec relations between spans, that may help to identify which spans are actually concepts and 
    how other spans are related.
    - Classes begin with a capital letter and are always singular, e.g. skos:Concept.
    - Properties begin with a lower case letter, e.g. rdfs:label.
    - Object properties should be verbs, e.g. org:hasSite.
    - Data type properties should be nouns, e.g. dcterms:description.
    - Use camel case if a term has more than one word, e.g. foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf. 

    Consider adding a relation to link between a Span and a Concept; 
         xmlns:span="http://example.org/irec-spans/"
         xmlns:concept="http://example.org/irec-concepts/"

            A CharacterSpan is a sequence of characters that occurs verbatim in a text, either contiguous or discontiguos as 
            extracted by a tool like SPaR.txt (Kruiper et al., 2021); It may contain a determiner (`the building`), may be 
            plural (`buildings`) or the span boundaries may be wrong (`buildi`) due to PDF-processing or extraction mistakes.

            exact type of relation. 
            These relations are used to suggest that concepts may be related. Therefore, they are annotated between spans.

            Reflexive property that relates a Span to another Span, each being each other's antonyms. We primarily expect to use
            WordNet's antonyms. The use-case is as follows; IF a Span has a semantically similar Span that has a irec:constitutes
            relation to some Span that has an antonym, then any Span that constitutes the antonym span should not be returned.
            Consider, e.g., how `cold water storage` should not be returned for a query on `hot water storage`.
